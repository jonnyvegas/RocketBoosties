# RocketBoosties
A 3d Unity rocket boosting game that behaves like a 2d boosting game.

This is built in Unity and C# and is able to run on windows and web (probably other platforms also). The idea is to get from one end of the level to the golden platform at the end without blowing up.
This project utilizes SceneLoading, 3d math, collision, input, UI and more. More will be added to this project to add polish in the future. Cheers!
